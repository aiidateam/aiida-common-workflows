Reference file showcasing how the submission of a `<Code>RelaxWorkChain` would work, when using
inputs generated through the method `get_builder` of a class `<Code>RelaxInputsGenerator`.
Moreover this example shows the required outputs of `<Code>RelaxWorkChain`, including the units specifications.

# This dictionary is the place where the user specifies the code and (optionally) resources
# to use in order to run the RelWC. 'relax' and 'final_scf' are two steps
# that the RelWC might have, and that might require two different codes.
# More generally: we expect the WorkChain to eventually run (one or more) CalcJob(s).
# These might require specific options, and need to know which code to use.
# Therefore, the generator should group all possible runs of CalcJobs in groups that share the same code
# and the same resources. We call them `calc_types`. The same code might be used by multiple calc_types (see
# e.g. example below) if the resources needed are very different.
# Multiple calculations might use the same calc_type, e.g. restarts in the same part of the WorkChain.
# The keys of the following calc_engines are the allowed calc_types; the values define the
# concrete values for each of these calc_types.
#The schema of calc_engines is code dependent, therefore there is a method to explore it,
#see next call
