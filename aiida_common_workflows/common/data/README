The elemental crystal cif files have been obtained from the
DeltaProject (https://molmod.ugent.be/deltacodesdft)
The cifs for Al and Fe belongs to the "primCIFs" set,
they contain all the symmetries specifications of the
crystal and the space group. They are the convinient choice for
codes that understand symmetries, however they are not the
one that have been used for the delta test reported in the
paper "Reproducibility in density functional theory calculations of solids"
(https://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6280/aad3000).
The structures used for the paper are conventional cells, that
guarantee minimal number of atoms in the cell also for
codes that do not understand symmetries. They are collected
in the folder "CIFs" of the DeltaProject.
We took from there the cif for Si.

The GeTe cif has been obtained from the AFLOW project
(http://www.aflowlib.org/) and it is the relaxed structure
obtained with DFT starting from the experimental cell
of ICSD with reference 659806.
